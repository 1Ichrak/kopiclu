Ever caught yourself copying and pasting the same word/text/file over and over again in case it didn't copy it the first time? Well, no more of that. Kopiclu (word play for copy clue) sends an instant visual clue for your copy & paste activity !

How to automatically run at startup (if you want it to automatically run in the background when your PC starts):

1. Press Win + R, type:
   shell:startup
   Then hit Enter to open your startup folder
2. Copy the Kopiclu.exe (a shortcut will do) into this folder
3. Voil√† ! Enjoy your one-click copying & pasting !

Note: Since the .exe uses the keyboard module, Windows may show a "run as administrator" prompt the first time you use it.
      If it doesn't work, run the .exe as admin.
